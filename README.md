Job seeker is an application built for those who struggle to find job postings related to their search.
In a saturated market, you find a job you like and you see that over 500 people have already applied, which produces defeat.
What is the solution? The solution is to be the first one to apply, but nobody wants to be viewing job boards every hour of
every day. That is where job seeker comes in - a website that asks you what specific roles you are looking for
and sends you an email every morning with the newest job postings.
